# Version File Generator

This is a command-line tool that generates a `version.h` file containing versioning information extracted from Git, along with user-specified metadata such as the author's name and engine name. This tool is particularly useful for integration into a custom build pipeline, where it can be executed before compilation to automatically fetch and embed the project's version information from Git.

## Features
- Extracts version information from Git (tag, branch, commit, timestamp).
- Includes author name, engine name, and copyright information.
- Generates a `version.h` file that can be used in C/C++ projects.
- Can be built and executed from the command line.

## Usage

`version -o <output path> -p <prefix> -e <engine name> -a <author name> -s <start year>`

### Parameters:
- `-o <output path>` : Specifies the directory where `version.h` should be saved.
- `-n <application name>` : Specifies the name of the resulting application. (default: "N/A")
- `-p <prefix>` : Specifies a prefix for the created defines. (default: "VER")
- `-e <engine name>` : Specifies the name of the engine (default: "N/A").
- `-a <author name>` : Specifies the author's name (default: "N/A").
- `-s <start year>` : Specifies the copyright start year (if omitted, defaults to the current year).
- `--verbose` : Will show more details on how the file is generated in the console.
- `-h` : Displays usage information.

## Building the Tool
Since there is no project file, you must compile it manually.

### Windows (MSVC)
Copy and paste the following command into a Developer Command Prompt:

`cl /EHsc main.cpp /Fe:version.exe`

### Windows (MinGW)
Copy and paste the following command into a terminal (cmd or PowerShell):

`g++ main.cpp -o version.exe`

### Linux/macOS (GCC/Clang)
Copy and paste the following command into a terminal:

`g++ main.cpp -o version`

## Example Usage

`version -o ./ -n "MyApp" -e "MyEngine" -a "John Doe" -s 2020`

This command will generate `version.h` in the current directory with the specified metadata.

## Output (`version.h`)

```

## Dependencies

A working installation of Git is required for retrieving versioning information.
A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

## Notes

- If Git is not installed or not in the system PATH, the tool will fail with an error.
The tool assumes it is being run inside a Git repository to extract version information.
- If -s (start year) is not provided, the tool will default to the current year.
- Rename the GEN_PREFIX to your liking
- This tool assumes a Git workflow where you're having a main branch for builds and a patch branch as a working space. As soon as the patch branch is rebased and pushed onto the main branch, the version will be bumped accordingly. The major version will only increase when you attach a tag to the main branch.
