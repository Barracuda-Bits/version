# Version File Generator

This is a command-line tool that generates a `version.h` file containing versioning information extracted from Git, along with user-specified metadata such as the author's name and engine name. This tool is particularly useful for integration into a custom build pipeline, where it can be executed before compilation to automatically fetch and embed the project's version information from Git.

## Features
- Extracts version information from Git (tag, branch, commit, timestamp).
- Includes author name, engine name, and copyright information.
- Generates a `version.h` file that can be used in C/C++ projects.
- Can be built and executed from the command line.

## Usage

`version -o <output path> -p <prefix> -e <engine name> -a <author name> -s <start year>`


### Parameters:
- `-o <output path>` : Specifies the directory where `version.h` should be saved.
- `-p <prefix>` : Specifies a prefix for the created defines. (default: "VER")
- `-e <engine name>` : Specifies the name of the engine (default: "N/A").
- `-a <author name>` : Specifies the author's name (default: "N/A").
- `-s <start year>` : Specifies the copyright start year (if omitted, defaults to the current year).
- `-h` : Displays usage information.

## Building the Tool
Since there is no project file, you must compile it manually.

### Windows (MSVC)
Copy and paste the following command into a Developer Command Prompt:

`cl /EHsc main.cpp /Fe:version.exe`


### Windows (MinGW)
Copy and paste the following command into a terminal (cmd or PowerShell):

`g++ main.cpp -o version.exe`


### Linux/macOS (GCC/Clang)
Copy and paste the following command into a terminal:

`g++ main.cpp -o version`

## Example Usage

`version -o ./ -e "MyEngine" -a "John Doe" -s 2020`

This command will generate `version.h` in the current directory with the specified metadata.

## Output (`version.h`)

An example `version.h` file generated by this tool:
```c
// DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.
// This file is auto-generated by version tool.
// Generation DTG: 2025-04-23T19:06:54Z

#ifndef __VERSION_H__
#define __VERSION_H__

#define VER_ENGINE_NAME "MyEngine"
#define VER_CPY_NOTE "\xA9 2020 - 2024"
#define VER_AUTHOR "John Doe"

#define VER_GIT_TAG "v1.0"
#define VER_GIT_BRANCH "main"
#define VER_GIT_COMMIT "abcdef1"
#define VER_GIT_DATE "2024-03-19"
#define VER_GIT_TIME "12:34:56"

#define VER_BUILD_DATE "2024-03-19"
#define VER_BUILD_TIME "14:20:00"

#endif
```

## Dependencies

A working installation of Git is required for retrieving versioning information.
A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

## Notes

- If Git is not installed or not in the system PATH, the tool will fail with an error.
The tool assumes it is being run inside a Git repository to extract version information.
- If -s (start year) is not provided, the tool will default to the current year.
- Rename the GEN_PREFIX to your liking
